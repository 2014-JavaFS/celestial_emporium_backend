# Welcome to Celestial Emporium
Proudly Serving the Sword Coast since 2024.

<p>This application is the backend half of an API meant to bring sellers and buyers together
to facilitate the exchange of coin and items, both magic and mundane.</p>

<p>To ensure the proper functioning of this backend, you will need: </p>
<ul>
<li>A frontend solution (please see our frontend project if you'd like to use it).</li>
<li>An application.properties file including access to a postgreSQL database of your choice.</li>
<li>A postgreSQL database with a defined structure laid out as in the attached ERD (or one generated by Spring Data).</li>
</ul>

<p>HTTP requests sent to this API should conform to the RESTful standard.</p>

<p>MemberType has the following tier structure/privileges that will need to be passed using a header.</p>
<ol>
<li>Waukeen, Goddess of Commerce, has unrestricted privileges including deletion of database.</li>
<li>Administrator may delete user account or alter privileges. They may also delete items (as opposed to item listings) from the catalog.</li>
<li>Seller (default registered user) can create listings via a POST request so long as it references an existing item in the items table as well as update their own listings.</li>
<li>Buyer (restricted registered user) can simply create a cart and purchase a transaction.</li>
<li>Unregistered. (memberType=null) Can view inventory and user profiles (GET requests only).</li>
</ol>
